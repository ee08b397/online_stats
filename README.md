# Basic pitfalls in programming for graphs using two approaches
* Computations w/ the adjacency matrix
* Different types of traversal queries
# What it means to aggregate instead of querying the graph at runtime. 
* (e.g. performance tradeoffs and space in RAM vs disk)
* Online approaches to computing a few graph statistics.
